# Migrate the legacy ./config.yaml location to ./config/config.yaml.
#
# 2.x bind-mounted ./config.yaml as a single file in Docker. That mount
# breaks when an editor (vim, etc.) replaces the host file via atomic
# rename: subsequent writes from the bot then go to an orphaned inode
# and never reach the host. 2.1 mounts the ./config/ directory instead,
# which is robust against atomic renames.
#
# Run this once on the host before `docker compose up -d` after pulling
# the new layout. Idempotent: no-op if already migrated.
